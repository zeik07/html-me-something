                    <h2>Asylum Demon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Every Dark Souls speed run story starts out very similar, you are locked in a cell in the Undead Asylum. After freeing yourself from your cell you must fight the very large Asylum Demon so you may start your pilgrimage through the world of Dark Souls.
                    </p>

                    <h2>Taurus Demon</h2>
                    <p>
                        After you have escaped the Undead Asylum you must first outfit yourself with the necessary equipment to survive in your journey. These are very simple things such as a bow and arrows and a few other items. After you have gathered yourself you will proceed on to fight Taurus Demon.

                    <h2>Iron Golem</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once you have defeated Taurus Demon you must the gather yourself a special weapon before continuing on, that weapon is the Drake Sword, the tail of a drake. Once you have cut the tail of the drake you continue on and skip past Sen's Gate using an advanced technique that is utilized by many Dark Souls speed runners. Once past the gate you continue on and fight the Iron Golem, in most encounters of the Iron Golem he will end up falling off to him doom.

                    <h2>Dragon Slayer Ornstein &amp; Executioner Smough</h2>
                    <p>
                        Now that you have defeated the Iron Golem you will continue on into the beautiful Anor Londo. Once in Anor Londo you are off to find yet another weapon, this weapon is the tooth of a dragon, the Dragon Tooth. The Dragon Tooth will be the last weapon you need to add to your arsenal before the end of your run as it is a very powerful weapon. You now continue on and face off against not one but two deadly foes. Dragon Slayer Ornstein &amp; Executioner Smough provide one of the most difficult encounters on your route.

                    <h2>Bell Gargoyles</h2>
                    <p>
                        After you dispatch of Ornstein and Smough you will obtain a very powerful artifact known as the Lord Vessel, it will allow you to warp to select areas you have already been to. Now you warp to the Undead Parish, an area you spent very little time in before doing Sen's Gate skip. Once you have returned to the Undead Parish you will work your way to Bell Gargoyles and quickly dispatch of both of them.

                    <h2>Chaos Witch Quelaag</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once you have taken care of the Gargoyles you will climb the bell tower and ring the bell high at the top. After ringing the bell you will warp to an area known as Firelink Shrine that you briefly visited after leaving the Undead Asylum. From here you will make your way through a few areas and eventually make it to Quelaag's Domain. Here you will fight and defeat Choas Witch Quelaag though she has been known to give some people trouble.

                    <h2>Sanctuary Guardian</h2>
                    <p>
                        After defeating Quelaag you will proceed to ring the bell that resides in her domain, this will open Sen's Gate (though you do not need it open since you already have the Lord Vessel) and it will also open access to Firelink Altar that you will need later. Now you will purchase the Crest of Artorias so that you may work your way to Sactuary Guardian. In order to reach the Sactuary Garden you must first defeat a Hydra so you may free Dusk. After dusk is free you must visit Duke's Archive near Anor Londo and obtain the broken pendant. All of these things must take place so you may enter the garden. Once there you will defeat the Sanctuary Guardian.

                    <h2>Knight Artorias</h2>
                    <p>
                        After defeating the Guardian you will make your way to Knight Artorias. Knight Artorias is a very unpredictable and erratic boss to fight but can be defeated none the less.

                    <h2>Gwyn, Lord of Cinder</h2>
                    <p>
                        Once Artorias has fallen you will use a Wrong Warp technique to warp to the area just before Gwyn, an area you should not be able to get to until much later. Once you are here you will run to Gwyn's room and fight and defeat him to end your run.
